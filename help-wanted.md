Many of the events in this repository were digitized manually from plots in papers, rather than using the original data, which has not been readily available. Ideally we want light curves that are host-subtracted, but *not* corrected for extinction either from the MW or the host, nor corrected for redshift.

Events that should be acquired from the discoverers in their original form:
* D1-9 (hand-digitzed)
* D3-13 (hand-digitzed)
* D23H-1 (hand-digitzed)
* TDE1 (e-mail from VV)
* TDE2 (e-mail from VV)

Events with poor host subtraction:
* ASASSN-14ae (host subtraction just using host magnitudes in each band pre-flare)
